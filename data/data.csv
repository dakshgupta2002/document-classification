It assumes that the S-corporation operates as a single business entity and that all of the income on Form 1120S, line 21, is Qualified Business Income for purposes of computing QBID. If the amount on line 21 is from more than One trade or business, use screen 199A to allocate QBI, W-2 wages paid, UBIA, REIT dividends, and PTP income among the separate trades Or businesses. If any of the amount on line 21 is NOT QBI, (for example investment income) use screen N199 to report that’ amount, and the W-2 wages paid, UBIA, REIT dividends, and PIP allocated to that  327 PRE-1981 METHOD FOR POST-1981 ASSET: A pre-1961 method has been selected for an asset placed in service post-1961. Review the depreciation method selection of ""D,"" ""DS,"" DB, ""DBS,"" ""DC,"" ""DCS,"" ""DD,"" of ""DDS"" on 4562 screens  357 BEGINNING- AND END-OF-YEAR TOTALS DO NOT TIE IN. On Schedule L, the beginning-of-year amount for line 24, column b (retained earnings) plus or minus current-year income or loss, minus current year distributions, does not tie to the end-of-year amount on Schedule L, line 24, column d. See WK M2, line 6.  HINT: Verify that all book-to-tax differences have been included on Schedule M-i, and that shareholder distributions have been reported on Schedule K, line 16d.  100 DEPRECIATION ERROR POSSIBLE: On screen 4562, a vehicle was placed in service during 2018, and either a Section 179 deduction was elected or a ""Method"" other than ""MACRS"" was chosen. Revenue Procedure 2019-13 Allows a safe harbor exception to the general rule that no Gepreciation deduction can be claimed in years two through five of the asset's life on a vehicle that qualifies for 100% bonus depreciation, Either:  * Forego future depreciation for this asset for years 2 through 5  + Elect out of bonus depreciation for 5-year assets on screen 10  * Change your ""Method"" on screen 4562 to ""MACRS"" and take no Section 179 expense +12086F  EF Transmission Status 2020 (ion you reer)  ‘Theftowing wl be anata to the RS.

(herp you ec 2020 EIONEER GYMNASTICS INC 20-1358030  0147 PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTED RETURN: Form 1120S for this corporation has been previously e-filed and accepted by the IRS  (IRS Business Rule R0000-932)  (IRS Business Rule R0000-932-02) If ""Amended Return” or (Superseded for 1120/1120S/1120-F/1041/1065)  checkbox is not checked, then taxpayer TIN in the Return Header must not be the same as a TIN of a previcusly accepted electronic return  for the return type and tax period indicated in the tax return, Notes about the return  2020 EIONEER GYMNASTICS INC 20-1358030  009 REQUIRED SECTION 199A INFORMATION ON SCHEDULES K-1: The program has automatically calculated relevant QBI information based on data entry, It is important that you review the calculated results and rely on your knowledge of this client's tax situation. It assumes that the S-corporation operates as a single business entity and that all of the income on Form 1120S, line 21, is Qualified Business Income for purposes of computing QBID. If the amount on line 21 is from more than One trade or business, use screen 199A to allocate QBI, W-2 wages paid, UBIA, REIT dividends, and PTP income among the separate trades Or businesses. If any of the amount on line 21 is NOT QBI, (for example investment income) use screen N199 to report that’ amount, and the W-2 wages paid, UBIA, REIT dividends, and PIP allocated to that  327 PRE-1981 METHOD FOR POST-1981 ASSET: A pre-1961 method has been selected for an asset placed in service post-1961. Review the depreciation method selection of ""D,"" ""DS,"" DB, ""DBS,"" ""DC,"" ""DCS,"" ""DD,"" of ""DDS"" on 4562 screens  357 BEGINNING- AND END-OF-YEAR TOTALS DO NOT TIE IN. On Schedule L, the beginning-of-year amount for line 24, column b (retained earnings) plus or minus current-year income or loss, minus current year distributions, does not tie to the end-of-year amount on Schedule L, line 24, column d. See WK M2, line 6.  HINT: Verify that all book-to-tax differences have been included on Schedule M-i, and that shareholder distributions have been reported on Schedule K, line 16d.  100 DEPRECIATION ERROR POSSIBLE: On screen 4562, a vehicle was placed in service during 2018, and either a Section 179 deduction was elected or a ""Method"" other than ""MACRS"" was chosen. Revenue Procedure 2019-13 Allows a safe harbor exception to the general rule that no Gepreciation deduction can be claimed in years two through five of the asset's life on a vehicle that qualifies for 100% bonus depreciation, Either:  * Forego future depreciation for this asset for years 2 through 5  + Elect out of bonus depreciation for 5-year assets on screen 10  * Change your ""Method"" on screen 4562 to ""MACRS"" and take no Section 179 expense +12086F  EF Transmission Status 2020 (ion you reer)  ‘Theftowing wl be anata to the RS.
